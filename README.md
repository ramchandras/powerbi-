# powerbi-
this is basic embedding of power bi report using react library 


initially we need to install following dependencies for the project 
npm install powerbi-client-react
npm create-react-app 

the main file is app.js which is used to host on local browser in my case it is hosted on https://localhost:3000.

we can finally embeded the powerbi report in our own web application.
